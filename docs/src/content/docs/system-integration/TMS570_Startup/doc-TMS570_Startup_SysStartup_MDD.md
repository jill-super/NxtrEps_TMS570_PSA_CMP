### Local Function resetStartup

### Local Function pwronStartup

#### Description

### Local Function afterSTC

#### Description

### Local Function memInitialization

#### Design Rationale

All VIM registers are cleared at the end of the startup initialization routine because the startup routine tests will set some interrupt flags during the testing (CCMSelfCheck).

#### Description

### Local Function cpuSelfTest

#### Description

### Local Function setupPLL

#### Design Rationale

This function configures the PLL settings.  These register settings assume 20MHz oscillator.  Changes to these values will drive changes to these register values.

#### Description

### Local Function efcSelfTest

#### Description

### Local Function periphInit

#### Description

### Local Function checkEFCSelfTestPassed

#### Description

### Local Function setupFlash

#### Design Rationale

The device ID is checked and if the gladiator revA part ID is detected, pre-emption is disabled.  This is to account for errata DEVICE#145 of revA parts.

For Archer device the flash bank wait parameter EWAIT is different from their champion counterpart. The device type is identified by reading the flash bank width of the flash bank configuration register. For Archer device type the flash bank width is 72 (0x 48). After identifying the device type the flash bank wait state is set accordingly.

# Software Module Implementation

## Runtime Environment (RTE) Initial Values

This section lists the initial values of data written by this module but controlled by the RTE. After RTE initialization, the data in this table will contain these values.

## Initialization Functions

(Note: For multiple init functions, insert new headers at the “Header 2” level – subset of “5.1 Initialization Functions” and follow the same sub-section design shown below)

### Init: _c_int00 / Startup

#### Design Rationale

This _c_int00 function is designed to be placed at the reset vector.   Since this function needs to be compiled in arm mode, it immediately branches to the Startup() function which can optionally be compiled in thumb mode to allow memory optimizations.  Since stacks are not available, the Startup() function needs to be defined as a Reset vector similar to _c_int00 so that the compiler does not try pushing data to the stack on entry to this function.

#### TI Recommended Initialization

Texas Instruments had provided a recommended startup sequence which the design was based from.  The document (spna106a.pdf) and accompanying source code (spna106a.zip) are located in the doc folder of this SWC.  Note that SysStartup code primarily handles up to step 35 of spna106a (excluding step 12, 29, 30).  Some of the notable deviations from the document include:

Addition of debugger connection detection to allow skipping initialization steps which interfere with debugging

Replacement of while(1) loops where failures occurred with Nexteer’s failure strategy summarized in section below

Use of configuration template headers to define initialization constants that may change from program to program

Handling of resets and use of “ResetCause” variable

Moving of mux initialization (Step 12 in spna106a) into application specific code (out of common initialization sequence)

Moving of SECDED logic check on RAM and Flash (Step 29, 30) into application specific code (out of common initialization sequence)

Some of the functions names were changed and the return type was changed to add clarity to the design (efcStuckZeroTest, checkEFCSelfTest)

#### Failed Initialization Diagnostic Strategy

A common strategy is used when diagnostics that are part of this initialization routine fail.  In general, the “ResetCause” variable is set to an appropriate value, the nError pin is forced low, and a software reset is performed.  The nError will put the controller into a known safe state.  The software reset will allow the rest of the initialization tests to be bypassed, as well as reset the controller’s registers to a known state.  The rest of the tests are bypassed to ensure the first failure is captured as the “ResetCause”, and the application can then evaluate the failure reason and set appropriate diagnostics codes (and communicate these on the communication bus if desired).  Note that the registers getting reset will also reset the nError pin state, so forcing the nError pin low is also done when processing the software reset.  Also note that for any of these diagnostics that fail, the general RAM banks will be initialized as part of the reset handling (as opposed to just initializing peripheral ram like most other resets).

#### Software Initiated Resets

For the two types of resets which can be initiated by software (CPU reset and SW reset), a strategy for setting the “ResetCause” variable has been used to allow for flexibility in adding new reset causes.  A check is done to see if the current value of the “ResetCause” indicates a power-on reset.  If this is the case, the initialization code assumes whatever code that initiated the reset did not explicitly indicate the reason for reset, and therefore the initialization code overwrites the value to the appropriate reset type (CPU or SW).  If the reset value is anything other than power-on reset, the initialization code leaves the “ResetCause” as-is under the assumption that whatever code that initiated the reset set this cause specifically.

If not a power on reset, there is an additional check for PLLSLIP and continue to do the same activity as a power on reset as we want to keep on being in safe state until the PLL is stable

#### Errata Processing

The device ID is checked at power-on and if the gladiator revA part ID is detected, a _esmCcmErrorsClear_() function is called to handle DEVICE#140 errata processing.
