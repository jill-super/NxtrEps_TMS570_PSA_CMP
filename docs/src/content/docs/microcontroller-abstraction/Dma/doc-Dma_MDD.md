# DMA & High-Level Description

DMA is a driver level module that performs flash, RAM, and peripheral reads and writes in the background, freeing up the CPU to do other work in parallel.  It is equipped with parity checking and an MPU, but timing and data consistency must be considered with respect to CPU execution.

# Design details of software module

# Variable Data Dictionary

## User defined typedef definition/declaration

* Note that the elements of this structure are dependent on whether the respective peripherals are configured to use DMA.  In the case that none of the ADC, SPI, or PWM groups are enabled in DMA, the type will not be defined.

# Software Module Implementation

## Initialization Functions

## Init: Dma_Init

## Design Rationale

The DMA module must encapsulate many possible configurations.  These configurations can be enabled or disabled per the configuration header file

enabled at the end of the function.  Once this is done, DMA will remain active for the remainder of the ignition cycle.  Individual channels can be enabled or disabled as needed, however.

## MPU Settings

The nature of the DMA MPU is different from that of the CPU.  The DMA has four configurable memory regions; anything outside of the declared regions is considered full access.  The regions may overlap, however, and are treated by “priority” – that is,  In light of this, the final memory region is used to cover the majority of the memory map.  The other three regions are configured to allow access to specific regions.  The following table shows the memory region allocations:

This configuration is based on safety analysis (included in FDD 52) and the DMA MPU limitations.

## Priority Assignments

Channels 0 and 1 are assigned low priority, while the other channels are assigned as high priority.  As channels 0 and 1 are used for FlsTst functionality, they are designed to be run “in the background”, while the other channels need high priority to ensure the MtrCtrl ISR is run on schedule.  Any unused channel is left at a default of low priority.

## Check Validity of Slow ADC Group

## Design Rationale

This function is provided as one part of the data integrity scheme.  The FDD requires that the DMA buffer be checked before the data is read, and cleared after the data is read.  This function is designed to be called before the ADC data is read, and returns FALSE if the data is invalid.  The FDD specifies that the data be copied if it is valid; for throughput and memory reasons, this is left as the responsibility of the caller.

## Description

<flow chart>

## Invalidate Slow ADC Group Buffers

## Design Rationale

To ensure that the DMA is running, this function is provided to be run after the DMA data is collected by the 2ms IoHwAbstraction component.  The buffers are cleared to 0xFFFF with the expectation that the DMA will fill them with proper data before the data is collected again.  If the DMA fails to do so, the cleared buffers will trigger the internal DMA diagnostic (implemented in Dma_SlowADCGroupValidity).

This is intended to be used as part of a larger data consistency scheme.  See Appendix A for more information on how this is designed to be used.

# Known Limitations With Design

This design only considers DMA transfers for a specific sensor configuration.  Older or newer programs may have other DMA needs that are not considered, and the design will need to be updated to accommodate those sensor configurations in time.

This design has only been verified on Champion hardware.  It would need to be validated on Gladiator hardware before use.

# UNIT TEST CONSIDERATION

None

# Appendix A – Configuration Schemes

The DMA module is intended to be configurable for any number of use cases.  While each channel is specifically assigned, each channel can be enabled or disabled per program.

The following diagram shows the MtrCtrl ISR groups and where they are designed to run.  The trigger points for each group, as well as non-configurable data formats and lengths, are based on this data and the corresponding peripherals.
