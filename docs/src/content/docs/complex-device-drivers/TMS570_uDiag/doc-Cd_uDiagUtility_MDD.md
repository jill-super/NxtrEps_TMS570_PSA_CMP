> Source: `TMS570_uDiag/doc/Cd_uDiagUtility_MDD.docx` (32,732 bytes, modern Word). Converted automatically with `python-docx`: headings, lists and up to 8 tables preserved. Figures and embedded objects are not preserved — see the original file for those.

# High-Level Description

Cd_uDiagUtility provides utility assembly language functions needed by the Cd_uDiag component.

# Figures

## Diagram – Function Data Sharing

No Shared Data

# Variable Data Dictionary

For details on module input / output variable, refer to the Data Dictionary for the application.  Input / output variable names are listed here for reference.

(Note: Full variable names required in table.)

(Note: All global variables including End Of Line data used should be shown here)

## Module Internal Variables

This section identifies the name, range and resolutions for module specific data created by this module.  If there are no range restrictions on the variable, the term “FULL” is placed into the table for legal range.

### User defined typedef definition/declaration

This section documents any user types uniquely used for the module.

# Constant Data Dictionary

## Calibration Constants

This section lists the calibrations used by the module.  For details on calibration constants, refer to the Data Dictionary for the application.

## Program(fixed) Constants

### Embedded Constants

All embedded constants whose values are provided in Eng units will be evaluated to the equivalent counts by using the FPM_InitFixedPoint_m() macro within the #define statement.

#### Local

#### Global

This section lists the global constants used by the module.  For details on global constants, refer to the Data Dictionary for the application.

### Module specific Lookup Tables Constants

(This is for lookup tables (arrays) with fixed values, same name as other tables)
