# Module  -- Spi Driver

# High-Level Description

This module provides the following Autosar API:

Spi_SetupEB()

Spi_Init()

Spi_AsyncTransmit()

Spi_GetSequenceResult()

This module provides the following TI Halcogen API:

mibspiSetCtrlData() – Note: this is a modified form of the standard mibspiSetData() API

mibspiTransfer()

mibspiGetData()

mibspiSetData()

The Autosar API naming has been altered from the Autosar standard to allow co-existence of this module and a Third Party Spi driver implementation in the same project.  SWC’s operating within the Rte can be mapped to either the Spi service ports offered by this BSW or the Third Parties Spi driver service ports by only changing the Rte service port mapping.

This driver exists to provide configurations/use cases that cannot provided by the third party Spi driver due to limitations in the design of the module.

The subset of the Texas Instruments Halcogen mibspi API  is provided specifically to support the Turns Counter Flash Programming SWC and the Digital MSB SWC.  If the Turns Counter Flash Programming SWC design and the Digital MSB design changed to use the standard Autosar API, then the provided mibspi API could be changed to module internal functions or removed.  However, the requirements of the Digital MSB component are such that its SPI usage does not fit easily into the Autosar API definition (more detail provided in section 9).

## Global Functions/Macros Defined by this Module

### Spi Setup External Buffer

#### Description

This driver function is a minimalist implementation intended for use with the Turns Counter component.  Additionally this function does not provide any error detection at this time. The function body is conditionally compiled such that the SetupEB functionality is provided when D_SPINXTUSEWITH_CNT_ENUM == D_SPINXT_USEWITHTC, and the function simply returns E_NOT_OK when D_SPINXTUSEWITH_CNT_ENUM has any other value.

### Spi Get Sequence Result

#### Description

### MIBSPI Transfer

#### Description

Set the Enable Transfer Group bit in the appropriate register to the transfer of the mibspi transfer group defined by the arguments:

mibspi->TGCTRL[group] |= 0x80000000UL

### Spi Asynchronous Transmit

#### Description

This driver function is a minimalist implementation intended for use with the Turns Counter component.  It assumes one-to-one channel-to-sequence correspondence.  The function body is conditionally compiled such that the Turns Counter-specific Asynchrounous Transmit functionality is provided when D_SPINXTUSEWITH_CNT_ENUM == D_SPINXT_USEWITHTC, and the function simply returns E_NOT_OK when D_SPINXTUSEWITH_CNT_ENUM has any other value.

### MIBSPI Set Data

#### Description

This function copies transmit data from the data[] argument into the appropriate mibspi ram transmit buffer, as selected by the mibspi and group arguments.  It is based on the Halcogen function of the same name.

### MIBSPI Set Control and Data

#### Description

This function copies transmit control and data words from the data[] argument into the appropriate mibspi ram transmit buffer, as selected by the mibspi and group arguments.  It is based on the Halcogen function mibspiSetData, modified to copy the complete transmit buffer including both control and data

### MIBSPI Get Data

#### Description

This function copies receive data from the appropriate mibspi ram receive buffer, as selected by the mibspi and group arguments, into the data[] argument.  It is based on the Halcogen function of the same name, modified to optimize for use with the Digital MSB since it will be called from the Motor Control ISR.  The function is conditionally compiled such that optimized Digital MSB specific functionality is provided when D_SPINXTUSEWITH_CNT_ENUM == D_SPINXT_USEWITHDIGMSB, and the original Halcogen functionality is provided when D_SPINXTUSEWITH_CNT_ENUM has any other value.

## Local Functions/Macros Used by this MDD only

### MIBSPI Set Data 8 Bit

#### Description

This function copies transmit data from the data[] argument into the appropriate mibspi ram transmit buffer, as selected by the mibspi and group arguments.  It  is based on the Halcogen function mibspiSetData, modified to copy from a uint8 buffer rather than uint16.

### MIBSPI Get Data 8 Bit

#### Description

This function copies receive data from the appropriate mibspi ram transmit buffer, as selected by the mibspi and group arguments, into the data[] argument.  It  is based on the Halcogen function mibspiGetData, modified to copy to a uint8 buffer rather than uint16.

### MIBSPI Enable Group Notification

#### Description

This function enables the transfer group interrupt for the mibspi, transfer group, and interrupt level defined by the arguments.

### MIBSPI Notification

#### Description

This is an error callback that is provided by the application and is called on an error interrupt.  The parameter passed to the callback is a copy of the error interrupt flag register.  It is hardcoded for channel 0/sequence 0 and the Turns Counter application.  Because it is hardcoded for the Turns Counter application, it is conditionally compiled such that it provides the Turns Counter error callback functionality when compiled with D_SPINXTUSEWITH_CNT_ENUM == D_SPINXT_USEWITHTC, and returns without doing anything when compiled with D_SPINXTUSEWITH_CNT_ENUM set to any other value.

### MIBSPI Group Notification

#### Description

This is a callback function provided by the application.  It is called when a transfer is complete.  The parameter is the transfer group that triggered the interrupt. This driver is designed to only receive data on mibspi3 group 0 for the Turns Counter communication function.   Because it is hardcoded for the Turns Counter application, it is conditionally compiled such that it provides the Turns Counter error callback functionality when compiled with D_SPINXTUSEWITH_CNT_ENUM == D_SPINXT_USEWITHTC, and returns without doing anything when compiled with D_SPINXTUSEWITH_CNT_ENUM set to any other value.

# Software Module Implementation

## Runtime Environment (RTE) Initial Values

This section lists the initial values of data written by this module but controlled by the RTE. After RTE initialization, the data in this table will contain these values.

## Initialization Functions

### Init: SpiNxt_Init

#### Design Rationale

The initialization function initializes mibspi3 and mibspi5 registers as needed by the Turns Counter and Turns Counter Flash Programming components, or by the Digital MSB component, controlled by a SpiNxt configuration parameter (see Integration Manual) which controls a constant value in the generated SpiNxt_Cfg.h file.  The initialization values are hardcoded in the SpiNxt.h file and are specified by the Turns Counter (), Turns Counter Reflash (FDD98) and Digital MSB () FDDs.

Additional information regarding initialization of MIBSPI3 when used by Turns Counter (per FDD20C):

The actual chip select for the PIC Turns Counter SPI transfers on MIBSPI3 uses a Dio channel, configured by the Dio and Port components as SPI_TCCS.  The required chip select hold time before SPI clocking begins is controlled by the use of the MIBSPI3 tick counter  triggering the SPI transfer.  (See SpiNxt_AsyncTransmit and the value of MIBSPI3_TICKCNT.)

The Dio chip select must remain low throughout the 10 byte transfer, with a minimum 9.5 usec delay between bytes.  It is desired to implement the 9.5 usec delay in  hardware.  In order to accomplish this with the TMS570 SPI peripheral, it is necessary to use the C2TDELAY, the T2CDELAY, and WDELAY as the sum of all three is needed to reach the desired delay time at an 80MHz VCLK rate.  More details provided in the C2TDELAY, T2CDELAY, and WDELAY sections of the tables below, to explain the values of MIBSPI3_DELAY and MIBSPI3_FMT0.

However, use of C2TDELAY and T2CDELAY requires transmit control words configured to use a MIBSPI3 chip select pin and to release the chip select between transfers.  Therefore a “dummy” SPI chip select is used in the control words in the transmit buffer (see value of MIBSPI3_BUFRAMCTRLINIT).  This chip select is toggled during the SPI transfer but only to accomplish the delay timing; it is not toggling a pin on the PIC Turns Counter.

# Known Issues / Limitations With Design

Driver has several functions and all initializations hardcoded for what is needed by the Turns Counter , the Turns Counter Reflash, or the Digital MSB.  Future modifications of the SPI interface of those components will probably require changes to this driver.  New uses of the SPI driver would also require driver changes.  Currently the only configurability is through the configuration parameter SpiNxt/SpiNxtGeneral/SpiNxtUseWith which selects either Turns Counter or Digital MSB functionality.

The Autosar API was not implemented for use by the Digital MSB for the following reasons:
a) The digital MSB triggers SPI transfers external to the SPI driver, through the NHET as set up in the ePWM component.  This means the SpiNxt_AsyncTransmit () function (if implemented for use by digital MSB) could not follow the Autosar requirement to initiate the transfer and set the driver/handler status accordingly.
b) The digital MSB transfers require chip select to be released after each word transferred.  This means the four words would have to be defined as four channels/four jobs.  Each channel requires its own buffer (internal or external). Because the SPI data reads and writes occur in the motor control ISR, they need to be very efficient and cannot afford the overhead of four calls to SpiNxt_SetupEB() that would be needed to implement the double buffering being done on the read data.  Use of a possible SpiNxt_ReadIB() would have this same issue even without the double buffering.

Several of the initialization constants (delay fields in the delay registers and data format registers, and the baudrate prescale field in the data format registers) have values that depend on the VCLK frequency.  These are currently hardcoded for 80 MHz VCLK for Digital MSB, and have values that will work for both 75MHz and 80MHz VCLK for Turns Counter / Turns Counter Reflash (see spreadsheet attached to Turns Counter Reflash FDD).  A future improvement would be to calculate these values based on a VCLK configuration parameter.
